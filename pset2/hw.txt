2 A Simple Function
    2, 246, 6, 8, 10
3 Fix the Function
    3.1 
        The error is that printNum() is called before it is declared
        1. Declare the function before main(), type void printNum(int number);
        2. Move the initialization before main()
    3.2
        An argument is passed into printNum() but printNum() doesn't take in any arguments
        1. Instead of defining num in main(), define it at the top using #define num 35
        this makes the variable global
        2. Add int number parameter into printNum()
        Number 2 is preffered because using global variables is bad practice
    3.3
        Double number only doubles its copy of num and it doesn't return anything
        Change doubleNumber(int num) into doubleNumber(int &num) so you pass a referece into it
    3.4 
        The function doesn't return anything when it should return an int
        Instead of using "int diff = abs(x-y)" use "return abs(x-y)"
    3.5
        3 arguments are passed into sum() but sum() only takes in 2
        Add a 3rd argument to sum()
    3.6
        yPtr should be a pointer so in the declaration
        it should be int *yPtr = arr + ARRAY_LEN - 1
4 Sums
    4.1
    4.2 It makes the call to sum() "ambiguous" because the compiler could use both
    4.3
    4.4 The compiler will say the call to sum() is "ambiguous" because sum(3, 5, 7)
    can call the sum function with 3 parameters or the sum function with 4 parameters and defualt values
    4.5
    4.6
5 Calculating pi
    5.calculate_pi
    This was like the buffon laplace needle thing
6 Array Operations
    6.1
    6.2 
    6.3 I couldn't figure out how to print the 2d array
    6.4 If output was defined inside of transpose() then once the function is finished output can't be accessed anymore
