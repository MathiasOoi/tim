2 Catch that bug
    2.1 doubleVal() changes the values of Point but on line 20
    Point is defined as a const, this will return an error
    2.2 Error on line 11 because the method has const but it changes x
    2.3 Error on line 16 because you can't access a private member outside of the class
        you'd have to use the getters
    2.4 Error on line 13 because when you define setX you need to specify it is 
        Point::setX()
    2.5 Need to use delete[] instead of delete
    2.6 Need to delete p
3 Point
    geometry.h
4 PointArray
    geometry.h
    geometry.cpp
    4.5.1 You need both const and not-const versions because you might want both of them
5 Polygon
    geometry.h
    geometry.cpp
    5.2 If you use the default copy method it will create a shallow copy of PointArray
    5.6
        1. If the constructurs are private then you can't create any instances
        2. Total numbers of polygons is decremented and the PointArray will also be delted
        3. So that classes that inherit from it can access the fields but not something else
        4. The parent getNumSides() will be called because the method isnt virtual
