3 More Programs
    3.1 
        1. When two variables are declared with the same name within a block
        there will be a compilation error and it says
        "redefinition of 'arg1' with a different type: 'char' vs 'int'"

        2, 3 and 4. When we declare an identifier in a block, and then redeclare that 
        same identifier in a block nested within that block, there will be no errors
        and the code will use the identifier in the current scope.

        5. The code does not compile because it calls std::cout before #include <iostream>
        to fix this move the #include <iostream> to the first line

    3.5 What does this program do?
        3.5.1 multiplies dole and bob
        3.5.2 returns an error because you cannot redefine a value
        3.5.3 sum of (-1)^n * 1/k^2 where k starts at 1 and increments by 1 until k equals n
4 Factorials gone wrong
    4.1 1, 1, 2, 9362880, 3628800
    4.2 when -1 is passed into the factorial program 1 is outputted
        you can fix this by check if the number passed in is positive or negative
    4.3 it fails at 17 because 17! is too big to store in an int
    4.4 No because the other inputs are either negative or too large
