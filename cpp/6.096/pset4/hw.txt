5 Graph Representation
    On line 25 the problem tells me to use "int Graph::numOutgoing(const int nodeID) const"
    but I got an error saying 
    "passing 'const std::map<int, std::vector<int> >' as 'this' argument discards qualifiers"
    I'm not sure why that is because I didn't modify the argument at all and removeing the const fixes this
